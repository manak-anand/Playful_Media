## *Why p5.js at all?*

When we first learned that our two-week coding module would be based on *p5.js*, I wondered — why this and not a game-specific engine like Unity (C#) or Unreal’s Blueprints?

This was answered on the first day itself: *coding wasn’t the main focus* — rather, it was about using code as a *creative tool* to explore ideas digitally.
Since not everyone in class came from a technical background, p5.js served as a beginner-friendly platform to introduce creative coding and logic visually.

---

## *Introduction to p5.js*

p5.js is a *JavaScript library for creative coding*, built for making interactive, visual, and generative art directly in the browser. Its web-based editor made it simple to experiment with ideas quickly.

---

## *Day 1 — Getting Started*

*What We Learnt:*

* Basics of p5.js and its creative possibilities
* Structure of a sketch (setup() and draw())
* Drawing shapes: rect(), ellipse(), triangle()
* Using color with fill(), stroke(), noStroke()
* Understanding the canvas and coordinate system

*Assignment:*
Represent an emotion visually using basic shapes.
*Emotion:* Sadness

*Concept:*
Used waves to represent sadness — waves get heavier each iteration, symbolizing depth and emotional weight.

*Functions Used:*
sin() wave, lerpColor() for gradient transitions.

*Key Takeaways:*

* Coding can visually express emotion and narrative
* The setup/draw loop is the foundation of p5.js
* Colors and shapes can translate mood effectively

---

## *Day 2 — Adding Movement & Interactivity*

*New Learnings:*

* Mouse interactivity: mouseX, mouseY
* Detecting clicks with mousePressed()
* Adding motion to shapes

*Assignment:*
Create a transition between Sadness → Anger using interactivity.

*Approach:*
Simplified waves for sadness → introduced spikes, sharper movement, and red-orange colors for anger.

*Takeaways:*

* Interactivity adds life to visuals
* Conditionals help manage transitions
* Smooth motion and timing enhance engagement

---

## *Day 3 — Conditional Logic & Generative Design*

*What We Learnt:*

* Conditional statements (if, else if)
* for loops for pattern repetition
* Using logic to control shape, color, and spacing

*Assignment:*
Use loops and conditions to create generative patterns.

*Takeaways:*

* Loops create rhythm and structure
* Small changes = large visual impact
* “Accidental learnings can be beautiful” — e.g., rotating the entire canvas produced better results unexpectedly

---

## *Day 4 — Image Transformation & Generative Art*

*What We Learnt:*

* Image manipulation with preload()
* Using sprite sheets and frame-based animation
* Creating generative art using images and loops
* Writing custom functions for reusability

*Takeaways:*

* Images + logic = complex visual systems
* Functions organize code efficiently
* Sprite-based animation introduces game design logic

---

## *Day 5 — Sprite Animation*

Explored sprite sheets further — understanding how frame-by-frame visuals can simulate motion.
This opened up exciting *2D web-based game possibilities* like platformers and arcade interactions.

---

## *Weekend Assignment — Interactive 30s Screen*

*Concept Development:*
Initially explored 3D forms but shifted to emotion-based visuals.
Experimenting with movement created a *parallax illusion, which evolved into a **retro-space narrative*.

*Final Idea:*

* Space = human headspace
* Spaceship = consciousness
* Destroying planets = emotional reactions
* Coded using LLM-assisted iteration → later rebuilt independently using learned class concepts.

---

## *Day 6 — Class & Objects*

*Learnings:*

* Defined custom class to create reusable object structures
* Called multiple instances efficiently
* Reduced code complexity drastically

*Takeaway:*
Classes made the logic cleaner, more readable, and modular — essential for scalable games.

---

## *Day 7 — Map() & Perlin Noise*

*Learnings:*

* map() re-maps value ranges for smoother visual control
* noise() generates organic randomness
* Used to create fluid, natural motion (terrain, waves, etc.)

*Takeaway:*
Mapping and noise open doors to natural, dynamic inputs — ideal for game systems like terrain generation or smooth player control.

---

## *Day 8 — Recreating PONG*

*Learnings:*

* Structured a full game from scratch
* Understood collisions, motion, and logic flow
* Balanced challenge through speed and timing
* Realized how small tweaks deeply affect gameplay feel

*Takeaway:*
Building Pong showed how logic, interaction, and play interconnect — our first taste of creating a fully functional game loop.

---

## *Game Poetry v2.0*

*Rebuilt Project:*

* Reimagined Week 1’s spaceship emotion sketch into an interactive “game poem.”
* Added background sound and emotional feedback effects.
* Introduced a dynamic emotion meter that changes in real-time.

*Takeaways:*

* Sound and interactivity amplify storytelling
* Responsive systems deepen emotional connection
* Layering visuals, sound, and logic creates immersive experiences

This module transformed how I view *code as a medium of play and expression* rather than a technical skill. Each exercise evolved from simple shapes into narratives, emotions, and interactive systems.
p5.js became a bridge for connecting art, logic, and play ; helping me see *the poetic side of game design through systems and code.*
